# AcmeFresh
This is a website made for Caliper Business in which we have to build a website for a hypothetical, 
state of the art Hydroponic farm company, AcmeFresh. The company obtains revenue different Sources:
  1) Setting up hydroponic farm infrastructure to customers
  2) Automating farm using modern techniques
  3) Selling produce directly to customers(B2C) from its website.
  from which I worked upon first 2 problems and Third one is in progress
  
  We can Improve this website by adding form for Inquiry purpose. By which company cam get back to customer regarding its inquiry or planning the purchase.
  For selling products directly to custemers we cam create a program in which the product seller will directly add his producs by form method and it will 
  show all products which sellers are ready to sale on the product page.
  
  To improve Automation page we cam add product there and sell it by inquiry or direct to custemer (B2C). 
  
  Other things which can be improved in this are we can give a DIY how to set up your own farm by just using some simple methods for homeuse perposes. 
  For which we can create some videos. Or we can sell our plans as well as equipements to customer.
